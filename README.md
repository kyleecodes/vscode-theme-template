# vscode-theme-template
After made my own Visual Studio Code themes, I figured I'd share this template of all the necessary JSON values for anyone to make their own theme!

## Try it yourself!
Head on over to the `vscode-theme-template` folder where you will find the theme template under `themes`!
The `vsc-extension-quickstart.md` file contains directions provided by the [code](https://yeoman.io/generators/) generator on [Yeoman generators.](https://yeoman.io/)


### Resources:
- Follow the directions [here](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/) in this article by CSS Tricks to create your own template from scratch!
- Use VSCode's in-browser theme generator [here](https://themes.vscode.one/)! It's super fast and easy!
- Check out the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color) for VSCode's theme color API! It's super useful and contains all the descriptions for every JSON value.
